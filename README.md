# Table Search Algorithm with Pygame Visualization

## Project Description
This project employs an advanced table search algorithm to find the best route within a given dataset or table. The project's goal is to identify the most optimal path between point A and point B within the specified data table.

## Features and Project Highlights
- Utilizes an advanced table search algorithm.
- Visualizes the search process using the Pygame library.
- Customizable algorithm to accommodate various types of data and route evaluation criteria.
- Presents the most cost-effective route based on specified criteria, such as time, cost, distance, etc.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame (for visualization)
- Table search algorithm
